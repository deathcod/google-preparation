## REVIEW 1

Having completed till Stack and Queue I now realise that I am very poor at solving the problem in pen and paper. It was very difficult to reflect the idea in the paper. I started solving the way I used to do in coding competitions, were I had a main function and everything implemented it. But while solving Linked List, I got the realisation that if the idea can be divided into classes than it is much more easy to think for the harder problems and just creating the object of the lower state. So while solving linked list I realised that object oriented setup is best as it is quick to debug in pen and paper and easy to explain. Next chapter was Stack and Queue this was following preety much the same until I faced the 3rd question which was a strong implementation problem. I was trying to create the modular form but was unable to handle all the situation at once. Then I started reading about the UML diagrams and implemented my first use - case diagram for explaination, I found that more ellaborate and clear and consice. By while coding I realised a flaw in coding style . That was I was not doing in complete object oriented way. I was not doing encapsulation and can access the nodes of other classes. Then I started all over to write the code in object oriented and encapsulated way. Till now this was the journey I faced.

## MOST CHALLENGING

To write in pen and paper was the most challenging part as every time I used to implement directly in the desktop. So this was the biggest change which I had to develop inside myself.

## WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED

* how to discuss the idea in pen and paper.
* to write clear code which is easy to understand and debug
* Object Oriented C++

## MOST INTERESTING

* finding errors in code using pen and paper.
* and seening myself cracking some crazy ideas.

## HARDEST BUG

* nothing as such, it was smooth.

## ENJOYED THE MOST

* Babling all the code and explaing to myself. At time my roomate was confused to whom he is talking, I think now he is confimed I am crazy.

## CONFLICT WITH TEAMMATE

* This task was single effort. So didnt had this experience.
