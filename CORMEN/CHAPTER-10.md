## 10.2-3

Implement a queue by a singly linked list L. The operation ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE should still take O(1) time.

## 10.2-4

As Written, each loop iteration in the LIST-SEARCH procedure requires two tests one for x != Nil[L] and one for key[x] != k. Show how to eliminate the test for x != nil[L] in each iteration.

## 10.2-5

Implement the dicitionary operation INSERT, DELETE, SEARCH using singly linked list, circular linked list. What is the running times of the procedure.

## 10.3-1

Draw a picture of the sequence {13, 4, 8, 19, 5, 11} stored as a doubly linked list using the multiple-array representation. Do the same for the single-array representation.

(Modifing the question to have a clear and complete code of multiple-array representation.)


## 10.3-2

Write the procedures ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT for a homogenous collection of ojects implementated by the single-array representation.

## 10.3-4

It is often desirable to keep all elements of a doubly linked list compact in storage using, for example, the first m index, locations in the multiple-array representation. (This is the case in a paged, virtual-memory computing environment.) Explain how the procedures ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT can be implemented so that the representation is compact. Assume that there are no pointers to elements of the linked list outside the list itself. (Hint: Use the array implementation of a stack)

(This complete is configured a single program of 10.3-4 on single linked list. As multiple-array dimension was conqured on the previous question.)
